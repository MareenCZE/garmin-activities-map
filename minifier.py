# This part of code is not required for functionality, it only helps to reduce size of the output.
# At the same time it is the least robust part of the code and has high potential to break in the future.
# It also requires you to have Java installed. It will download Closure Compiler jar from the internet on the first run.
# All in all, if the page does not load for you correctly, start with disabling minification.
#
# Code below applies various optimizations to reduce size of the resulting html (with javascript).
# Folium output is repetitive and not optimized for situation where you have many polylines sharing their config.
#
# Effect on my sample of Ëœ2000 activities:
#   - original output from Folium:          8.77 MB
#   - after removing redundant definitions: 7.80 MB
#   - after compiling with Google Closure:  6.34 MB (i.e. overall reduction by ~28%)
#
# Note that your web server and browser likely support compression and therefore transferred size will be even less: 1.54 MB in my case.
